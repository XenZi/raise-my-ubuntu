# Some of dotfiles for pre-configuring Ubuntu!

Before anything, just want to say Hello!

This is my preffered starting configuration for Ubuntu Desktop with GNOME DE (used and created on the 20.04 Focal Fossa).

`./raise-my-ubuntu.sh` script will install a suggested programs and apps that could be found under the *scripts* directory. 

Before running the commend, I'm suggesting a reading this **README** file.


# Usage

After installing clean Ubuntu (I guess any other Debian distro would work too), please download this package via download button.

After downloading, please open your Terminal (if you are too lazy to find it, default shortcut is **CTRL + ALT + T** on Ubuntu), and make your way to the file

    cd ~/Downloads/raise-my-ubuntu
After entering into the folder, you can write:

    ./raise-my-ubuntu
  You will be asked to write down your password so the packages could be installed.
  When you get the output that tells you that you are able to use your Linux now, seems everything went fine :)
